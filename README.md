## Why Rust?

Historically, C has been mainly used for OS development because of its portability,
minimal runtime, direct hardware/memory access, and (decent) usability.
Rust provides all of these features with addition of memory safety guarantee,
strong type system, and modern language abstractions
which help programmers to make less mistakes when writing code.

## Acknowledgement

We built our labs based on the materials originally developed for
[CS140e: An Experimental Course on Operating Systems](https://cs140e.sergio.bz/)
by [Sergio Benitez](https://sergio.bz/).
We have ported it to use newer toolchains such as Rust 2018 edition,
`cargo-xbuild` (instead of `xargo`), and `no_std` Rust with a minimal shim library
(instead of custom built std).
Weâ€™ve also developed it further to include topics such as virtual memory management, multicore scheduling, mutex designing, and implementing a networking stack.
